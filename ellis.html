            <h3>Wants to hear a fairy tale? </h3>
            <p> 
                
                Fortunately, this isn't a tale of magic spells and enchanted forests, but it's a delightful story about the day I crossed paths with some incredible Alaskan folks. <br>
                
                Back in 2020, I received a call to embark on a full-time missionary journey in Canada, Winnipeg. Imagine my excitement when I cracked open that missionary assignment letter! With just six months to prepare for the adventure ahead, I found myself facing a mountain of gear to gather. Being a missionary in Canada meant I needed loads of thermal clothing, and as you can guess, it wasn't exactly budget-friendly. <br>
                
                With no job and my parents unable to foot the bill for all my gear, you can imagine my relief when an old friend reached out with unexpected news. It turns out there was a missionary group itching to lend a hand with my gear. And here's where the plot thickens â€“ by some stroke of luck, Jen and Brant were vacationing in Costa Rica at the time, and they were eager to chip in. Talk about serendipity in action! <br>
                
                I'll never forget the day I welcomed them into my home. There was something special about Jen and Brant from the get-go. Throughout my mission, we kept in touch, and before I knew it, they were extending an invitation for me to stay with them in Alaska for a few months. Can you believe it? If this isn't straight out of a fairy tale, I don't know what is! <br>

                        <p class="expanding-p">Alena was one of my best friends during my stay in Alaska, I remember first day she and her friends made a big concert upstairs. <br> 
                        she is the youngest daugther of the family, her room was front of mine, one day at the mind of the night I put a tiny pillow front of her door rooms and I knocked the door and then run away <br>
                        of course that action was like a war called for her and she did the same until it finish with a mountain of pillows front of her door room <br>
                        she was always trying people with love and kindness, and has a different way to try the people she fell in love with, most part of my nights upstairs was giving Alena love advises <br>
                        We started to watch an anime called your lie in april, of course she liked, that was my favorite anime. she is really good at cooking cookies. <br>
                        during those  boring nights she was there as my little friend. </p>
